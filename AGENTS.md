## graphify

This project uses Graphify for dependency/impact navigation and Repomix for compact task-scoped source context.

When the user types `/graphify`, use the installed graphify skill or instructions before doing anything else.

Rules:

* For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when `graphify-out/graph.json` exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`, `graphify explain "<concept>"`, and `graphify affected "<symbol>"` to produce a minimal file set.
* Pack only that file set with Repomix (`--include`, `--compress`) under `graphify-out/repomix/`; inspect the pack before opening exact current source ranges.
* If Repomix's security scanner excludes a selected path, record it and read only that Graphify-selected file's exact source range; never bypass the scanner.
* Do not begin with broad search, repository walking, direct whole-tree grep, or guessed-file browsing. These are fallback-only after stating the exact Graphify/Repomix gap.
* Dirty `graphify-out/` files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip Graphify. Only skip Graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
* If `graphify-out/wiki/index.md` exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
* Read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
* After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
